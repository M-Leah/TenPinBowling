# Technical Assessment.
The following project is my personal attempt at a technical assessment which I was asked to complete prior to an interview. The deadline for this project is the **2nd March**.

### Assumptions Made
Below are a list of assumptions I have made during the creation of this project.

#### Game Assumptions
- Players can Foul as well as score 0 to 10.
- Players can choose to change their name during play.
- Players can update previous scores in case of an incorrect entry.
- On the final frame if the player gets a Spare followed by a strike, the third ball is not given.

#### Project Assumptions
- PHP Frameworks are not allowed.
- External Libraries are not allowed (i.e. PHPMailer).
- The JQuery Library is allowed.
- Package Management tools such as Composer are not allowed for auto-loading, etc.
- I am allowed to expand on the brief if I believe it to be appropriate to the design of the end product.
- A backend MySQL database is allowed where appropriate.

### Incomplete Areas (Some areas were not implemented due to time constraints. )
- Foul (Not Implemented) 
- Displaying how many pins a user has knocked down and not just the score. 
- A few minor errors that were not fixed.
